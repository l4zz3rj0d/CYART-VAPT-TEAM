# Exploitation – Metasploitable2

## Objective
To validate identified vulnerabilities by performing controlled exploitation
and demonstrate the real-world impact of insecure service configurations.

## Target Information
- Target Machine: Metasploitable2
- Target IP: 192.168.56.5

## Exploitation Method
Based on the results of network scanning, an exposed Apache Tomcat Manager
service was identified on the target system. The service was found to be
accessible using weak or default credentials.

Credential validation was performed using the Metasploit auxiliary module
`auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login`, which successfully identified valid
authentication credentials for the Tomcat Manager interface.

Using the obtained credentials, the Metasploit exploit module
`exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload` was used to upload a malicious WAR file
via the Tomcat Manager application. Successful deployment and execution of the
payload resulted in remote code execution on the target system.

## Result
The exploitation was successful and resulted in remote code execution through
the Apache Tomcat Manager interface. An initial **low-privileged shell** was
obtained on the target system, confirming a high-severity vulnerability due to
insecure credential management and improper access control.

Privilege escalation was not achieved during this phase and was performed
separately during post-exploitation.

## Evidence
- Successful credential discovery using Tomcat Manager login scanner
- Malicious WAR file upload via Tomcat Manager
- Remote code execution and shell access
