# Evidence

This directory contains screenshots and artifacts collected during the API
security assessment.

The files here provide proof of:
- Sensitive data exposure during content discovery
- IDOR/BOLA exploitation through request manipulation
- Unauthorized access to other users' data
- OTP bypass leading to successful account takeover
- Caido proxy requests and responses validating each finding

Each screenshot corresponds to the workflow documented in the main API report.
